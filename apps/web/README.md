Minimal Next.js app-router scaffold with Tailwind CSS and ESLint.

## Run

1. Install dependencies:
   - `npm install`
2. Start dev server:
   - `npm run dev`

## Notes

- This scaffold was created manually as a fallback for environments where `create-next-app` or package download may be blocked.
- If network access is restricted, dependency installation may fail until registry access is available.
