# Agent Status Board

## Agent 1
- STARTED (2026-02-25): Issue #6 `apps/web` 공통 GNB/FNB 레이아웃 작업 시작. 계획 파일: `apps/web/app/layout.js`, `apps/web/app/globals.css`, `docs/agent-status.md`. 리스크: 네비 토글 인터랙션은 범위 외(`app.js`)라 구조/접근성 스켈레톤 중심으로 구현.
- DONE (2026-02-25): Issue #6 commit `d9df4ca`. 검증: `git diff --check` 통과, `apps/web/app/layout.js` 내 GNB/FNB/유틸리티 링크(Search/Login/Cart/MyPage) 및 모바일 내비 스켈레톤 확인, `cd apps/web && npm run lint`는 `next: not found`로 실행 불가(의존성 미설치). 인계: 토글 동작 연결은 `app.js` 또는 클라이언트 컴포넌트 후속 작업 필요.
- STARTED (2026-02-25): `index.html` 패션/에디토리얼 MVP 구조 작업 시작. 계획 파일: `index.html`, `docs/agent-status.md`. 리스크: 스타일/스크립트 미완성 상태에서 훅(id/class/data-category)만 선반영.
- DONE (2026-02-25): commit `bac9c92`. 검증: hero/collections/editorial/craftsmanship/contact 섹션, 모바일 내비 토글 스켈레톤(`id=\"mobile-nav-toggle\"`, `aria-controls=\"primary-nav\"`), CSS/JS 훅(id/class/data-category) 포함 확인. 인계: 스타일/인터랙션은 Agent 2/3 연동 필요.
- STARTED (2026-02-25): 문서화 작업(`PRD.md`, `IA.md`) 시작. 소스 기준: `docs/웹사이트 개발 구성계획서.md`, `docs/개발계획서-TODO-스케줄.md`. 리스크: 소스 문서가 현재 worktree에 없어 상위 저장소 원본을 참조해 동기화 필요.
- DONE (2026-02-25): commit `33922d9`. 검증: `PRD.md`/`IA.md` 생성, MVP 범위/Out-of-scope/Acceptance criteria 명시, 신규 문서 ASCII 확인(비ASCII 없음). 인계: `API.md`는 아직 미작성이며 다음 주차 백로그 항목으로 진행 필요.
- STARTED (2026-02-25): issue #7 design tokens in `apps/web/app/globals.css` started. Planned files: `apps/web/app/globals.css`, `docs/agent-status.md`. Risk: add tokens and utility classes without breaking existing component styles.
- DONE (2026-02-25): issue #7 commit `7328851`. Verification: `git diff --check` clean, `rg -n "[^\\x00-\\x7F]" apps/web/app/globals.css` no matches, manual review confirms color/typography/spacing/radius/shadow tokens and utility classes are defined with responsive-safe variables. Handoff: components can now use `u-*` token utility classes or CSS custom properties directly.

## Agent 2
- STARTED 2026-02-25: owning `styles.css`. Plan: define tokenized visual system, responsive layout, and subtle motion hooks for likely HTML/JS states (`.is-open`, `.is-visible`, `[aria-expanded]`). Risks: `index.html` and `app.js` are not present in this worktree, so selectors are based on likely integration hooks.
- DONE 2026-02-25: commit `654ea0b544e4312bb691b31837ed29358bd8ac11`. Verification: CSS file created with variables, layered background, responsive breakpoints (48rem/64rem), reduced-motion handling, and JS-state hooks (`.is-open`, `.is-visible`, `[hidden]`, `[aria-expanded]`), plus explicit Agent 1 hook support for `#mobile-nav-toggle`, `#primary-nav`, semantic section spacing, and `[data-category]` cards. ASCII check passed via `rg` non-ASCII scan. Handoff: Agent 3 can toggle mobile nav via `aria-expanded` on `#mobile-nav-toggle` and `hidden`/`aria-hidden`/`.is-open` on `#primary-nav`.
- STARTED 2026-02-25: delegated API documentation task for week1 in `API.md`. Plan: draft auth/product/cart/order endpoints with request/response samples, shared error model, and versioning rules. Risks: endpoint shapes are MVP draft and may require backend alignment before implementation.
- DONE 2026-02-25: commit `767d151`. Verification: `git diff --check` passed; `rg -n "[^\\x00-\\x7F]" API.md` returned no matches; manual review confirms auth/product/cart/order draft endpoints, request/response examples, shared error model, and versioning policy are documented. Handoff: backend implementation should confirm final field names, status code mapping for validation errors, and token/session lifecycle details.
- STARTED (2026-02-25): Issue #21 sold-out handling in `apps/web` shop list/detail. Planned files: `apps/web/app/shop/page.js`, `apps/web/app/shop/[slug]/page.js`, `apps/web/app/globals.css`, `docs/agent-status.md`. Risks: keep interaction semantics clear (no cart action for sold-out) while minimizing component-level changes.
- DONE (2026-02-25): Issue #21 commit `f65a679`. Verification: `git diff --check` clean; `node --check apps/web/app/shop/page.js` and `node --check apps/web/app/shop/[slug]/page.js` passed; `cd apps/web && npm run lint` failed with `next: not found` in this environment. Handoff: sold-out products now render explicit sold-out state on list/detail and disable add-to-cart action when sold out.
- STARTED (2026-02-25): Issue #29 option-based price/stock accuracy in product detail. Planned files: `apps/web/lib/catalog.js`, `apps/web/app/shop/[slug]/page.js`, `docs/agent-status.md`. Risks: maintain backward compatibility for existing list/detail consumers while introducing variant resolution defaults.
- DONE (2026-02-25): Issue #29 commit `ceff4c2`. Verification: `node --check apps/web/lib/catalog.js` and `node --check apps/web/app/shop/[slug]/page.js` passed; `git diff --check` clean; smoke check via `node --input-type=module` confirmed default variant resolution and final price/stock computation. Handoff: product detail currently applies first available variant as safe default on initial render; client-side option switching can reuse `resolveSelectedVariant`, `computeVariantPrice`, and `computeVariantStock`.

## Agent 3
- STARTED (2026-02-25): Scope `apps/web` scaffold initialization (Next.js app-router + Tailwind + ESLint) and status updates. Planned files: `apps/web/**`, `docs/agent-status.md`. Risks: network-restricted environment may block `create-next-app`/dependency install; fallback is a committed runnable skeleton with manual install step documented.
- DONE (2026-02-25): Commit `54a6002` created `apps/web` minimal Next.js app-router scaffold with Tailwind (PostCSS plugin) and ESLint flat config. Verification: `node --check` passed for `next.config.mjs`, `postcss.config.mjs`, `eslint.config.mjs`, `app/layout.js`, `app/page.js`; `timeout 20s npm install` timed out in this environment (dependency download likely blocked). Handoff: run `npm install && npm run dev` in `apps/web` when network/registry access is available.
- STARTED (2026-02-25): Scope `app.js` only. Plan: implement mobile nav toggle, reveal-on-scroll stagger, collection filtering (`ALL/OUTER/TOP/BOTTOM` via `data-category`), rotating testimonial text with progressive enhancement and null checks. Risk: HTML/CSS hooks may differ until Agent 1/2 land final markup.
- DONE (2026-02-25): Commit `1b1a142` implemented `app.js` interactions with null-safe progressive enhancement (nav toggle, `.reveal` observer stagger, category chips filter, testimonial rotation). Verification: `node --check app.js` passes. Handoff: selectors are intentionally tolerant because final HTML hooks are pending from Agent 1/2.
- DONE (2026-02-25): Commit `6038941` aligned nav selectors and state handling to Agent 1 hooks (`#mobile-nav-toggle`, `#primary-nav`, `data-state`). Verification: `node --check app.js` passes after update. Handoff: reveal/filter/testimonial logic remains progressive and no-ops safely when corresponding hooks are absent.
- STARTED (2026-02-25): Issue #8 `apps/web` Home + Shop dummy pages. Planned files: `apps/web/app/page.js`, `apps/web/app/shop/page.js`, `apps/web/app/globals.css`, `docs/agent-status.md`. Risks: keep styles minimal while still providing clear mobile/desktop product grid and category chips on both pages.
- DONE (2026-02-25): Issue #8 commit `57dce68` created dummy Home (`app/page.js`) and Shop (`app/shop/page.js`) pages with sample product grid and category chips, plus minimal shared styles in `app/globals.css`. Verification: `node --check` passed for `app/page.js`, `app/shop/page.js`, `app/layout.js`; `git diff --check` clean; `npm run lint` failed in this environment because `next` is not installed (`sh: 1: next: not found`). Handoff: run `npm install` in `apps/web` then rerun lint/dev locally.
- STARTED (2026-02-25): Issue #20 Product Detail enhancement in `apps/web/app/shop/[slug]/page.js` started. Planned files: `apps/web/app/shop/[slug]/page.js`, `apps/web/lib/catalog.js`, `apps/web/app/globals.css`, `docs/agent-status.md`. Risks: keep selectors/data shape backward-compatible with existing shop list and maintain no-JS baseline.
- DONE (2026-02-25): Issue #20 commit `debd127` implemented data-driven product detail enhancements (gallery block, size/color selectors, size guide, shipping/exchange summary, and related products) in `apps/web/app/shop/[slug]/page.js` with supporting catalog fields and styles. Verification: `git diff --check` clean, `rg -n "[^\\x00-\\x7F]" apps/web/app/shop/[slug]/page.js apps/web/lib/catalog.js apps/web/app/globals.css` no matches; `npm run lint` not re-run because `next` dependency is unavailable in this environment. Handoff: gallery thumbnails are presentational placeholders; interactive image switching can be layered with a client component later without changing data shape.
- STARTED (2026-02-25): Issue #29 product detail option UI state update started. Planned files: `apps/web/components/product/OptionSelector.jsx`, `apps/web/app/shop/[slug]/page.js`, `apps/web/lib/catalog.js`, `apps/web/app/globals.css`, `docs/agent-status.md`. Risks: preserve no-JS baseline while adding variant-level client state and keep style changes minimal.
- DONE (2026-02-25): Issue #29 commit `56d97c2` added client-side option selector UI for product detail, wired variant stock/price calculation, and disabled Add to Cart when selected variant stock is zero. Verification: `node --check apps/web/app/shop/[slug]/page.js` and `node --check apps/web/lib/catalog.js` passed; `git diff --check` passed before commit; `cd apps/web && npm run lint` failed with `next: not found` due to missing dependency in this environment. Handoff: selector is progressively enhanced (server-rendered default + client hydration) and falls back to disabled cart action when variant metadata is missing.

## Agent 4
- STARTED (2026-02-25): Scope `.github/workflows/*` and `docs/*` only.
  Planned files: `.github/workflows/pr-policy.yml`, `docs/automation-labels.md`, `docs/workflow-guide.md`, `docs/agent-status.md`.
  Risks: branch naming mismatch with existing branches, false positives in path/scope validation, missing coordinator token for assignment automation.
- DONE (2026-02-25): Commit `e328df42f427406637dc17f2b0dbb0b7b55e355d`.
  Verification: `git diff --check` clean; manual review of `pr-policy.yml` branch/scope rules and idempotent coordinator-stub comment logic.
  Handoff: Added concrete Agent 1 completion example (`agent1/mvp-v2`) in automation docs for cross-agent feedback and completion-contract reference.
- STARTED (2026-02-25): Scope `apps/web` CI workflow + docs handoff update.
  Planned files: `.github/workflows/web-ci.yml`, `packages/.gitkeep`, `README.md`, `docs/agent-status.md`.
  Risks: `apps/web` does not exist yet in this branch, so workflow must skip gracefully until web workspace is added.
- DONE (2026-02-25): Commit `c4e93f6`.
  Verification: `git diff --check` clean; reviewed `.github/workflows/web-ci.yml` trigger paths and `hashFiles('apps/web/package.json')` skip guard; confirmed README Week1 run section and `packages/.gitkeep` placeholder.
  Handoff: CI runs on PR/push changes under `apps/web/**` and executes install/lint/typecheck/build once the web workspace is added.
- STARTED (2026-02-25): Issue #25 SEO metadata/OG for `apps/web` pages.
  Planned files: `apps/web/app/layout.js`, `apps/web/app/page.js`, `apps/web/app/shop/page.js`, `apps/web/app/shop/[slug]/page.js`, `apps/web/app/not-found.js`, `docs/agent-status.md`.
  Risks: Keep canonical/base metadata compatible with local/dev environments while avoiding hardcoded external production domains.
- DONE (2026-02-25): Issue #25 commit `3fbb390eb89164760a784ed27eeabe5c72c3dc14`.
  Verification: `git diff --check` clean, `node --check` passed for updated app route files, metadata now includes layout-level `metadataBase` + canonical and page-level OG/Twitter/dynamic product metadata/not-found metadata; `cd apps/web && npm run lint` failed in this environment with `next: not found` (dependency missing).
  Handoff: Placeholder base domain uses `https://project-b.example`; replace with deployment domain/env-driven value during release wiring.
- STARTED (2026-02-25): Issue #36 order state machine draft + order creation API initial state integration.
  Planned files: `apps/web/lib/order-state.js`, `apps/web/app/api/v1/orders/route.js`, `docs/order-state-machine.md`, `docs/agent-status.md`.
  Risks: 기존 주문 API 구현이 아직 없어 route는 MVP mock 수준으로 제한하고, 상태 전이 규칙을 독립 유틸로 설계해 후속 서버 연동 시 재사용 가능하게 유지.
- DONE (2026-02-25): Issue #36 commit `47424ff`.
  Verification: `node --check apps/web/lib/order-state.js` and `node --check apps/web/app/api/v1/orders/route.js` passed; `git diff --check` clean; `node --input-type=module` smoke check confirmed `ORDER_INITIAL_STATE=pending_payment`, valid transition `pending_payment->paid=true`, invalid transition `delivered->paid=false`.
  Handoff: `POST /api/v1/orders` now initializes `status` from `ORDER_INITIAL_STATE`; replace mock fields/ID generation with real cart/pricing persistence in backend integration.
