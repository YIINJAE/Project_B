## Agent 2
- STARTED 2026-02-25: owning `styles.css`. Plan: define tokenized visual system, responsive layout, and subtle motion hooks for likely HTML/JS states (`.is-open`, `.is-visible`, `[aria-expanded]`). Risks: `index.html` and `app.js` are not present in this worktree, so selectors are based on likely integration hooks.
- DONE 2026-02-25: commit `<pending>`. Verification: CSS file created with variables, layered background, responsive breakpoints (48rem/64rem), reduced-motion handling, and JS-state hooks (`.is-open`, `.is-visible`, `[hidden]`, `[aria-expanded]`). ASCII check passed via `rg` non-ASCII scan. Handoff: if Agent 1/3 use different class names, map their hooks to the provided utility/state selectors.
