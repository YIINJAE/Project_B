- STARTED (2026-02-25): Scope `app.js` only. Plan: implement mobile nav toggle, reveal-on-scroll stagger, collection filtering (`ALL/OUTER/TOP/BOTTOM` via `data-category`), rotating testimonial text with progressive enhancement and null checks. Risk: HTML/CSS hooks may differ until Agent 1/2 land final markup.
- DONE (2026-02-25): Commit `1b1a142` implemented `app.js` interactions with null-safe progressive enhancement (nav toggle, `.reveal` observer stagger, category chips filter, testimonial rotation). Verification: `node --check app.js` passes. Handoff: selectors are intentionally tolerant because final HTML hooks are pending from Agent 1/2.
